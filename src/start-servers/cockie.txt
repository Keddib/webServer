To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
HTTP response.  In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a
Cookie request header to the origin server.  The Cookie header
contains cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie
headers.  The origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or
use its contents for an application-defined purpose.


Origin servers MAY send a Set-Cookie response header with any
response.  User agents MAY ignore Set-Cookie headers contained in
responses with 100-level status codes but MUST process Set-Cookie
headers contained in other responses (including responses with 400-
and 500-level status codes).  An origin server can include multiple
Set-Cookie header fields in a single response.  The presence of a
Cookie or a Set-Cookie header field does not preclude HTTP caches
from storing and reusing a response.


example 
 == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

The server can alter the default scope of the cookie using the Path
and Domain attributes.  For example, the server can instruct the user
agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
example.com.

== Server -> User Agent ==

Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Domain=example.com

== User Agent -> Server ==

Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42
