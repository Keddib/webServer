We splited the work into two parts:
1 -> managing sockets: read request and parse it. sending response to client (non-blocking).
2 -> pasrsing config file and and hundling requests based on configuration & CGI.

2Part Todolist:

- [x] read config file;
	- [x] set a data structres to store virtual servers
	- [x] handle errors;
	- [x] set default dirivtives to default values if not defined on condig file
	- [x] create Servers interface that holds all valid Virtual servers
	- [x] add "return" to location and "error_page" to server
	- [x] add upload path to location

- [x] Server and Location Block Selection
	- [x] select which Server block will handle a request based
	on IP:PORT and SERVER_NAME
	- [x] select which Location block will serve a request based on path

- [x] create defualt error pages
	- [x] implement response generator that generete responses based on status code
	- [x] check if user defined error pages if not not use defualt ones instead.

- [] handle requests
	- [x] create a Response class
	- [] implement a Reqhandler class that takes request and create a response
	based on configuation
	- [] if the requested resource is a CGI script just print CGI on output.
	CGI will be handled later.
	- [] directory listing -> function that list content of a directory.

- [] handle CGI
	- [] add request headers to envirment variables wih "setenv(n,v,or)"
	- [] create a new process
	- [] if method=GET add QUERY_STRING env if post open body file and dup to cgi-input
	- [] get out put and create a response



-> [] heade fields values lower-case !!!!
-> [] if Version 1.0 and host not found set Host to "_".

!!!! note the server can't handle more than one request .. it hangs out ???
