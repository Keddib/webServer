WHAT TO DO!!


What is a HTTP server ?
	- what is OSI model?
	- what is TCP/IP ?
	- To implement HTTP, we only care about 4th Layer: Transport Layer // I am not sure yet...
	- what the heck is RFC!??? should we read them all ?
	- HTTP/1.1 â†’Initially it is RFC 2616 but later replaced by RFC 7230, RFC 7231, RFC 7232, RFC 7233, RFC 7234, RFC 7235.
	So, do we need to read from RFC 7230 to RFC 7235 to implement a HTTP server? // https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt
	- what are TCP and UDP?
	- should we build it on top of TCP or UDP?
